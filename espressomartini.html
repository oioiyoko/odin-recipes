    My favorite cocktail.
</p>

<p>
    The classic espresso martini, also known as a vodka espresso, is a cold caffeinated alcoholic drink made with espresso, coffee liqueur, and vodka.
    It is not a true martini as it contains neither gin nor vermouth, but is one of many drinks that incorporate the term martini into their names.
